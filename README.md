[Yet another good-question-checklist for Stack Overflow!](https://can-i-haz.codes)

## But... why? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Because, sometimes when a post really, really screams "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! I need tha codez now!" (most of the time by new users, but definitely not always), I link this page in the comments. 

### Okay, but... why?

OP didn't put **any** effort in writing a even normal question (you know, a question mark at the end of the sentence and phrases like "do you know", "does someone", "what is going on", etc. Not "I need", "I want to have", etc.), so I'm not putting any effort in explaining why this is a problem in the comments. There's this page, and this should be enough explanation when read carefully. 

### And what's the problem with questions like that?

I'm helping voluntary in my free time, and "questions" like this don't value my time at all. Secondly, those questions are simply useless to Stack Overflow and its philosophy. Stack Overflow wants to be a Q&A page, not a free code writing service.

### Spread the word üì£

So whenever you stumble over a "gimme cods now!"-question, you're invited -- if you agree with the points made on the site, of course -- to spread the word:


```Hi and welcome to Stack Overflow! [Right now, your question looks like a can I haz codes?-question](https://can-i-haz.codes) what is off-topic on SO. Either follow the steps on the first link, read **[How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)** or visit **[the Help Center](https://stackoverflow.com/help)**. After that, edit  your question accordingly. Good luck!```


‚ö†Ô∏è And **please, please**, if you use it, adjust this message to fit the individual post (Would be emberassing if your comment started with "Hi and welcome...", but the user has like 1.000 reputation, right?) ‚ö†Ô∏è
